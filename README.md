# FCC-BasicAlgorithmScripting-MySolutions

These are my solutions for the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" portion of the Front End Development section in FCC. Since these algorithm challenges were solved when I was a beginner, my coding practices for many of these solutions may seem questionable when considering efficiency, which is also why my code for many of these challenges may look drastically different to the provided solution in the official FCC wiki.

##Solutions
|[Challenge 1 - Reverse A String](src/reverse-a-string.js)|[Challenge 2 - Factorialize a Number](src/factorialize-a-number.js)|[Challenge 3 - Check for Palindromes](src/check-for-palindromes.js)
